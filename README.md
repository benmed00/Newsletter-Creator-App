# Newsletter-Creator-App

## **Project Scope and Objectives**  

The core objective of this project is to create a **dynamic newsletter builder** with an intuitive and responsive user interface. Users should be able to create professional-quality newsletters by selecting predefined templates or building custom ones using a form-based template editor.

The application should include the following key functionalities:  
1. **Newsletter Builder**:  
   - WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor for designing newsletters.  
   - Drag-and-drop components (text, images, buttons, dividers, etc.).  
   - Form-based input for specifying content (title, body, images, links, etc.).  
   - Real-time preview of the generated newsletter.  
2. **Template Management**:  
   - Predefined templates for commonly used newsletter layouts.  
   - Ability to save and load custom templates.  
   - Export functionality for newsletters in multiple formats (HTML, PDF, etc.).  
3. **User Authentication & Roles**:  
   - User registration and login (JWT-based authentication).  
   - Role-based access (Admin, Editor, Viewer).  
4. **Backend Integration**:  
   - REST API integration for data storage and management.  
   - Email scheduling and sending functionality via third-party services (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun).  
5. **Analytics & Reporting**:  
   - Track newsletter performance (open rate, click rate, etc.).  
   - Generate detailed reports on user engagement.
